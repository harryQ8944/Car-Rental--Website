# Car-Rental--Website

Visual Components
1) Website logo
2) Search box
3) Car categories
4) A grid view of cars
5) Reservation
User can view the car that she/he intends to ren (car model, price per day) and edit the quantity to rent,
start date and end date of the renting, and the total price for the rental duration.
User can 1) cancel this reservation, 2) proceed to place an order for the car, or 3) simply leave this page.
In the third case, the reservation information will be kept in Cookie/Session; so, the user can later resume
the previous reservation. When the user presses the “rent” button next to another car, the reservation will
change for making the rental booking for the new car.
User must provide name, mobile number, email address and valid driver’s license available to place an
order. All are compulsory for the order to be placed.
User can only rent one car model at a time.

7) Order confirmation
Once an order is placed, the page shows a web link which the user can click to confirm the order. The
rental order is not placed until the user clicks the Web link.
This confirmation will trigger an update of the JSON file and MySQL database.
